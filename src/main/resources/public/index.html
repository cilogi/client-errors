<h1>Serving static files</h1>
<p>
    You can serve static files from the resource folder <code>public</code> by including the directive
    <code> staticFileLocation("/public");</code>
</p>
<p>
    This file is <code>index.html</code> and, since its at the top level of public, gets served at the
    root of the web application (ie <code>/index.html</code>).
